## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Beautiful, accessible components
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API calls
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

### Backend
- **Python Flask** - Lightweight web framework
- **Flask-CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd back
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Riot API (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Get your API key from [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
   - Create a `.env` file in the `back` directory:
   ```bash
   # .env file
   RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key_here
   RIOT_API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND=20
   RIOT_API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
   CACHE_TYPE=simple
   CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=300
   FLASK_ENV=development
   FLASK_DEBUG=True
   ```
   - **Note:** Without an API key, the app will work in demo mode with mock data

5. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd front
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Start Both Servers**: Make sure both backend (port 5000) and frontend (port 3000) are running

2. **Search Your Summoner (Optional)**:
   - Enter your League of Legends summoner name and region
   - The app will analyze your recent ranked games and champion performance
   - This provides personalized recommendations based on your actual play history

3. **Build Team Compositions**:
   - Use the Champion Pool section to search and filter champions
   - Click "Ally" to add champions to your team (max 4)
   - Click "Enemy" to add champions to the enemy team (max 5)

4. **Select Your Role**:
   - Choose from Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, or Support
   - This determines which champions will be recommended

5. **Get AI Recommendations**:
   - Click "Get Recommendations" to receive AI-powered suggestions
   - View detailed reasoning for each recommendation
   - See scores based on synergy, counters, and your play history
   - Recommendations will be enhanced if you've searched your summoner

## üß† AI Algorithm

The recommendation system considers multiple factors:

- **Team Synergy**: How well the champion works with your allies
- **Counter Potential**: How effectively the champion counters enemies
- **Personal Preference**: Bonus for champions in your play history
- **Role Optimization**: Champions optimized for the selected role

### Scoring System
- **80-100**: Excellent pick (Green)
- **60-79**: Good pick (Orange)  
- **0-59**: Fair pick (Red)
